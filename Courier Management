Courier Management System â€“ Project Overview
Introduction
The Courier Management System is an intranet-based web application developed using ASP.NET and MS SQL Server. The primary goal of this project is to streamline and digitalize courier service operations, particularly across multiple branches, by providing a centralized system to manage consignments, users, and delivery logistics efficiently. Designed for use in a distributed environment, this system ensures seamless interaction between the headquarters and its regional branches.
